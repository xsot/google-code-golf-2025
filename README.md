## Project details

For easy viewing, [all_tasks.py](https://github.com/xsot/google-code-golf-2025/blob/master/merged/all_tasks.py) contains our best submissions pre-compression.

The `submission/` directory contains our full final entry to the competition. This directory, `merged/` and `tasks.json`, are auto-generated by `merge_and_submit.py`, which packages the best solutions from each team member's individual directories into a single best solution. zlib compression is applied along the way by the compress function in `compress.py`.
