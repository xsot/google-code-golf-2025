## Project details

The `submission/` directory contains our full final entry to the competition. The contents of this directory, alongside the contents of `merged/` and `tasks.json`, are auto-generated by `merge_and_submit.py`, which packages the best solutions from each team member's individual directories into a single best solution. zlib compression is applied along the way by the compress function in `compress.py`.
